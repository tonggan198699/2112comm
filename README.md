# 2112 comm code challenge

This task is to replicate John R. Doe's portfolio page http://nicolas-logeais.fr/Site_John_R_Doe/index.html
- I did this with Laravel which uses bootstrap for the front end.
- With Sass where I put all my css in a file called app.scss.
- Using the blade templating engine I was able to break blade files as partials, and extending to one layout files.
- The only back end code is to do with the contact form that allows anyone to send out emails to the admin.
- The contact form uses the built-in Notification feature for sending emails, where all the validation rules are stored in a Form Request class, and the email sending logic is also put into a controller...
- To test out the email sending feature, you should configure the email setting in the .env file, for example I am using MailTrap which gives me a testing email account which comes with the necessary email credentials.
